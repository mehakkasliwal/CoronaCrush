## Corona Crush
A COVID-era arcade-style game I built during my sophomore year of high school (2020).
Developed for a sandbox environment using JavaScript and educational libraries like CodeHS.

## Gameplay
- Dodge and destroy bouncing virus particles
- Shoot antibodies using a moving needle
- Survive 3 levels to save the world

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (simplified, educational environment)
- WebImage, setTimer, key/mouse listeners — designed for sandbox platforms

## Note
This was a personal project made during the early days of the pandemic — it's intentionally simple and nostalgic.  
Best viewed in a browser-based JavaScript sandbox (not a standalone JS app).
